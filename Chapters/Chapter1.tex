\section{The Area of Work}
Autonomous Vehicle are cars and trucks that can understand and navigate the environment with little to no help from a human driver. While consumers cannot yet buy a car that fully drives itself (Level 4 or 5 automation)\cite{J3016_202104}, the technology is under development and improving quickly. The self-driving cars being worked on today have many different sensors and cameras to capture information about the world. So, a big challenge in the field of Computer Science and Engineering is to make a Artificial Intelligent network which takes the captured information and gives the best possible action a car should in that state of environment. My project aims to try to build a network capable of taking some of the actions and to able to drive a car efficiently.

\section{Problem Addressed}
An autonomous vehicle is made with the goal to make travel of an individual safer than non autonoumus ones. The environment being partially observable and undeterministic, an autonomous vehicle should be prepared to take action based on any outcome. So an artificial intelligent model which can take decision in any type of environment is desired. Thus we need a model that can learn and adapt on its own in any type of scenarios. This is why a neural network based model is ideal for the use case and forms the heart of any autonomous vehicle. Since driving a vehicle in not efficient, we need a simulator which can create a close-to real world environment. Grand Theft Auto - V fits this criteria perfectly. Thus the main objective is to design, train, and simulate a autonomous vehicle in GTA-V and try to make the model as efficient as possible.
