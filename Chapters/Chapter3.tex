\section{Dataset}
Since there is shortage of dataset in the simulator, I have created a program to generate a dataset while a user plays the game. The data recorder consists of an image and 4 required labels. 

\subsection{Labels}
The dataset comprises of four labels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Throttle Value}} is the value of the acceleration the car is in. Throttle value 1.0 means forward acceleration, 0.0 means backward acceleration and 0.5 means no acceleration.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Throttle Flag}} is a boolean value which states whether there is an acceleration.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Steering Value}} is the value of the steering of the car. Steering value 1.0 means left steering, 0.0 means right steering and 0.5 means no steering.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Steering Flag}} is a boolean value which states whether there is an steering.
\end{itemize}
