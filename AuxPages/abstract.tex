Autonomous Vehicle is a highly appealing sphere exciting all of the mankind. Several factors governs the decision making for the vehicles making legacy artificial intelligence networks inefficient. With the ever changing environment for the vehicles to drive on, automobile industry required an control system able to adapt with the environment.
\\
Advancement in Deep Learning Algorithms helped majorly in fulfilling the requirement. With the self-adapting capability of the deep learning algorithms or neural networks, engineers are trying to make a fully-autonomous car.
\\
With the advancement of time several neural networks have be developed which made creation of autonomous car very much closer from dream to reality.
\\
In this project, the objective is to understand the Transformer Network, a neural network said to currently the best architecture and understands its applicability in automobile industry. To achieve this objective, an autonomous vehicle will be simulated with its control system built on top of a transformer network.
